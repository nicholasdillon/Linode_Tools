`# Script Explanation

The provided Python script interacts with the Linode API to manage volumes (storage devices) associated with a Linode account. Here's a detailed breakdown of the script:

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries:
```python
import requests
import json `

### 2\. Set Your Personal Access Token:

Replace `'your-personal-access-token'` with your actual token.

pythonCopy code

`access_token = 'your-personal-access-token'`

### 3\. Prepare the Headers:

These headers are used to authenticate with the Linode API using your access token.

pythonCopy code

`headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}`

### 4\. Send a GET Request:

Retrieve a list of all volumes associated with your Linode account.

pythonCopy code

`response = requests.get('https://api.linode.com/v4/volumes', headers=headers)
volumes = response.json()`

### 5\. Filter Unattached Volumes:

Include only those volumes that are not attached to any Linode (their `linode_id` field is `null`).

pythonCopy code

`unattached_volumes = [volume for volume in volumes['data'] if not volume['linode_id']]`

### 6\. Loop Through and Delete Unattached Volumes:

pythonCopy code

`for volume in unattached_volumes:
    volume_id = volume['id']
    delete_url = f'https://api.linode.com/v4/volumes/{volume_id}'
    response = requests.delete(delete_url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f'Successfully deleted volume {volume_id}')
    else:
        print(f'Failed to delete volume {volume_id}. Response: {response.text}')`

Within the loop:

-   The `volume_id` of each unattached volume is extracted.
-   A DELETE request is sent to the Linode API to delete the volume.
-   If the response status code is `200`, the deletion was successful and a success message is printed to the console.
-   If the status code is not `200`, the deletion failed and an error message is printed to the console, including the response text from the Linode API.

This script automates the cleanup of unattached volumes to help manage resources within a Linode account.
