### Delete All PVC

#### Description:

The "Delete All PVC" script likely performs an operation related to deleting or managing Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) in a Kubernetes or containerized environment. PVCs are typically used to request durable storage resources in container orchestration platforms. This script may interact with the Kubernetes API or another container orchestrator's API to delete all existing PVCs.

#### Instructions:

1.  Dependencies: Check if the script requires any external dependencies or libraries.
2.  Configuration: Look for any placeholders or configuration variables within the script that may need customization, such as API credentials or specific PVC names.
3.  Usage: Understand the intended use case and execute the script accordingly. Be cautious, as it may irreversibly delete PVCs.

#### Notes:

-   Ensure that the script is compatible with the version of the container orchestrator you are using.
-   Confirm the script's permissions and ensure it has the necessary access to manage PVCs.

### Reboot All Linodes

#### Description:

The "Reboot All Linodes" script likely initiates a reboot operation for all Linodes associated with a Linode account using the Linode API. Linodes are virtual private servers provided by Linode, and a reboot can be triggered for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes. This script may use the Linode API to iterate through all Linodes and send reboot commands.

#### Instructions:

1.  Dependencies: Check if the script requires any external dependencies or libraries.
2.  Configuration: Replace any placeholder values (e.g., API keys) with your actual credentials.
3.  Usage: Execute the script to trigger a reboot for all Linodes associated with the specified account.

#### Notes:

-   Exercise caution, as initiating reboots can temporarily interrupt services running on the Linodes.
-   Ensure that the Linode API key used in the script has the necessary permissions to perform reboot operations.

Before running either script in a production environment, thoroughly review the code, understand its functionality, and consider testing it in a controlled or non-production setting.
