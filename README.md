# Linode_Tools

Sure! The provided Python script interacts with the Linode API to manage volumes (storage devices) associated with a Linode account. Below is a detailed explanation of what each part of the script does:

Import necessary libraries:
python
Copy code
import requests
import json
Set your personal access token as access_token. Replace 'your-personal-access-token' with the actual token:
python
Copy code
access_token = 'your-personal-access-token'
Prepare the headers for the HTTP request. These headers are used to authenticate with the Linode API using your access token:
python
Copy code
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
Send a GET request to https://api.linode.com/v4/volumes to retrieve a list of all volumes associated with your Linode account:
python
Copy code
response = requests.get('https://api.linode.com/v4/volumes', headers=headers)
volumes = response.json()
Filter the list of volumes to include only those that are not attached to any Linode (their linode_id field is null):
python
Copy code
unattached_volumes = [volume for volume in volumes['data'] if not volume['linode_id']]
Loop through each unattached volume, sending a DELETE request to https://api.linode.com/v4/volumes/{volume_id} to delete each one:
python
Copy code
for volume in unattached_volumes:
    volume_id = volume['id']
    delete_url = f'https://api.linode.com/v4/volumes/{volume_id}'
    response = requests.delete(delete_url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f'Successfully deleted volume {volume_id}')
    else:
        print(f'Failed to delete volume {volume_id}. Response: {response.text}')
Within the loop:

The volume_id of each unattached volume is extracted.
A DELETE request is sent to the Linode API to delete the volume.
If the response status code is 200, the deletion was successful and a success message is printed to the console.
If the status code is not 200, the deletion failed and an error message is printed to the console, including the response text from the Linode API.
This script automates the cleanup of unattached volumes to help manage resources within a Linode account.
